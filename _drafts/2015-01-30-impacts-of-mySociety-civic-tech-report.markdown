The Third Sector and Online Citizen Empowerment: the Case of mySociety

        While our results do not suggest that these sites are radically expanding the numbers engaging in community or political action in the UK they do show the sites are having an effect in subtler and potentially more meaningful ways. In particular we do see evidence that they are widening the repertoire of ways people can take action to resolve issues affecting them, and offering an easier mechanism for those people who might not otherwise have bothered, to take public action. Furthermore they seem to be providing an additional ‘booster shot’ to those who are active in politics or local affairs, leading them to increase their levels of investment, particularly in more communal or collective forms of action.

        The key question we were interested in answering was whether the sites make a difference to a person’s feeling of competence and efficacy in being able to tackle social, political and community problems, and particularly whether it enabled those starting from a lower confidence base to do so.

        Based on the feedback provided it was possible to identify a certain set of core functions that the sites were seen as particularly useful in performing and that appeared to be very positively regarded by users. One of the strongest and most important of these was their capacity to act as an information dissemination tool. This finding clearly dovetails with the survey results reported above which indicated that one of the main drivers for visiting the sites was to seek out information. The focus groups discussants clearly considered mySociety sites to act as an effective channel to keep them informed on issues of interest.

        What these results appear to show is that those people that are making most use of the mySociety sites are also developing an increasingly stronger level of commitment and involvement in their local community over time. So while the sites may not be mobilizing people from scratch who have no involvement and interest in local affairs, they do appear to help support and reinforce the commitment of those who are active in trying to make a difference.

        What we discovered was something of a virtuous circle operating whereby increased levels of commitment and a positive connection to one’s local area flowed from getting involved in some type of collective action. The ‘feel good’ factor that people experienced through ‘acting together’ with others to generate change was clearly a strong motivational force to get involved &hellip; While this cooperation may be targeted toward and fostered by some major project or event that requires local mobilization what comes across most strongly from the diarists is how far it is ‘low key’ regular daily contacts with neighbours and people in the local area that helps build and strengthen a connection with the community &hellip; Despite being a fairly loose form of connectivity it is clear that these linkages and interactions are crucial developing and sustaining what we might call a ‘community-minded’ context in which there is a system of informal networks of neighbours and residents that organise events, actions but also to spread information. As the above diarists continues to say: “(...) it's a lot easier to organise things where there are existing networks - both because that means there are already community minded people around, and because it provides a means of contacting them.”

        Overall, therefore, it is clear from our qualitative research that some changes are occurring over time among the users of mySociety sites and these appear to center on (although are not necessarily limited to) their levels of involvement in the local community &hellip; This has shown us that the individual level forces motivating people to get involved and help out in one’s local community are not based on instrumental or utilitarian desires to procure particularized benefits for one self or one’s family. Instead they would appear to be linked closely to self-validation needs and a desire to be part of a larger social entity or quasi ‘family’ structure even. That said, opportunity structures matter and having effective communication channels and the space to support and engage in these community building activities is vital. Finally and perhaps most importantly, however, beyond individual motivations and relevant external practical infrastructure, a key factor moving people into closer community involvement is whether or not they perceive the presence of a community that is cohesive and receptive to efforts for change. The more palpable this community context for them, then the more they will do to support it.

        Based on our focus group and time diary evidence it is clear that the trigger or catalyst to action on mySociety sites is for the most part designed to advance an individual’s particularistic or what we might even regard as ‘selfish’ interests. &hellip; Despite this individualistic basis or origins to the action it is clear from the narratives given by those performing them that the motivation for their efforts and repeated attempts is actually conceived and understood in more ‘collective’ terms. In reporting these problems they are doing so with a strong sense of responsibility towards their community. &hellip; mySociety sites offer a means for people to take action alone on an issue of importance to them, but also allows them to do so in a public forum which imbues the act with a wider sense of collective responsibility. &hellip; While we would not claim from these data that the mySociety sites ‘create’ activists we would argue that they do help provide a new and important platform or channel that serves to transform or ‘convert’ private concerns into something that approximates a public ‘good’. &hellip; This outward spiral of individual to collective action certainly offers one potential explanation for the increasing sense of community efficacy and involvement found among regular users.

        <p>Overall our findings have clearly underscored the importance and benefits of mySociety sites in that the vast majority of users are clearly satisfied with their experience and many return to use the facilities they offer repeatedly. Despite the positive response to the sites it was not clear from our survey evidence that use of the sites had produced any marked shifts in users’ feelings toward governing authorities and their own competence and skills to influence such bodies. Part of this lack of an effect is likely to result from the fact that most of those using the sites already possess a significant level of participatory resources. Moving further up the scale of involvement is thus a rather hard task. Also part of the reason for not detecting impact may rest on the measurement tool itself. Large scale opinion surveys inevitably rely on capturing change quantitatively using bounded scales. As such they struggle to detect subtler but potentially profound changes occurring among a smaller group of individuals using the site.</p>

        <p>Interestingly it does appear from our more nuanced individual level diary data and group discussions that more frequent use of the sites may have a wider collective benefit or ‘spin off’. In particular it appears that more engagement with the sites is linked to an increase in what we have termed community ‘efficacy’ - the view that one can help to improve or make a difference to one’s local community. The precise way in which this spiral of involvement works is not fully clear. However, based on respondents’ account of their growing feelings of mobilization through using the sites we have argued that it may be happening through a shift in perspective whereby what are effectively particularized and personal concerns or complaints are moved onto a public platform and individuals become conscious of their wider collective voice and responsibilities.</p>
