Human fallibility is at the cornerstone of the design of our political institutions. It is why we have systems of checks and balances. We all know that there is imperfect information and that these imperfections of information play out in some of the most important decisions we have to make.

Thus, to pretend that any institution is infallible, or that there is perfect confidence in the actions being undertaken, is to fly in the face of reality. Only those who want to be fooled will be. Admission of fallibility and demonstration that one can learn from oneâ€™s mistakes should enhance public confidence in an institution, at least by demonstrating that the institution has enough confidence in itself and in democratic processes to engage in open discussions.
