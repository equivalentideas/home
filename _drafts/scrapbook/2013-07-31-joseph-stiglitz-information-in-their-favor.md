The existence of secrets give rise to a press determined to ferret out the secrets. One of the ways in which public officials reap the rents is to disclose “secrets” to those members of the press that treat them well. Thus, not only is the public deprived of timely information—which I have argued is theirs by right—but government officials use their control of information to distort information in their favor. It is not just the puff pieces of which public officials are so fond. Rather, it is the very characterization of events and circumstances.
