the time is never ripe for public discussion. One “ delicate ” moment is followed by another. And secondly, the public is all too often treated disparagingly: it is entitled to know the arguments for the proposal, but not the pros and cons that went into it — like a child who should not witness disagreements between the parents. But the public knows that few matters are black and white. Issues of public policy involve judgments, often about matters concerning which there is considerable complexity and uncertainty.
