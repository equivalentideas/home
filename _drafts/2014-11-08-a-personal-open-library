## intro

Inspired by the [Good, Form & Spectacle Library](https://openlibrary.org/people/george08/lists/OL62310L/Good_Form_Spectacle_Library) and by [Readmill](http://readmill.com/).

## Setup

I set up a jekyll collection using a [basic tutorial from Site Point](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-jekyll-collections/).

My first ‘text’ was Robert Bringhurst’s *What is reading for?*, which I had read a few days earlier.

[Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) and [Ruby interface gem](https://github.com/jayfajardo/openlibrary)
