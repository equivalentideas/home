Equivalent Ideas
================

This is the code repository for [equivalentideas.com](http://equivalentideas.com), the online home of Luke Bacon (my personal website). All the code that makes the website, and all the content for the journal posts, lives here.

The site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I've made the code behind my site public in the hope that it may be helpful to others (and also to take [my own medicine](http://equivalentideas.com/journal/tpp-against-a-narrowing-circle/ 'Against a narrowing circle: Secrecy in the TPP Negotiations')). You can see [my to-do-list for this website](https://github.com/equivalentideas/home/issues?state=open) and [also the full list of changes and additions that have been made from the get-go](https://github.com/equivalentideas/home/commits/gh-pages). 

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me on Twitter [@equivalentideas](http://twitter.com/equivalentideas) or via email to <luke@equivalentideas.com>.
