# Principles for Indendent Archives

Here are some broad, basic goals for an independent archive project and design principles which could help the project achieve them.

This is meant to be the start of a conversation. Any kind of rough contribution or idea is very, very welcome.

Contributions could include:

* leaving a comment of any length with a response or thought about what an independent archive should do;
* making suggestions for adding or cutting principles;
* suggesting references for more information on individual principles;
* improving the explanations of principles; and/or
* pointing out how wording could be improved/typos etc. .

## Goals for an independent archive

* Reduce the cost of using and acting on the evidence in the archive.
* Engage new people in the records.
* Preserve access to the evidence for as long as possible in as many ways as possible.



## Principles

###  Use open standards

Presenting records/data in a consistant, standardised, common format reduces the cost for others to use and act upon them. Open, long lived formats, standards and structures have a better chance of lasting over time than closed, proprietary standards.

### Think long term

From day one, plan for shut down. All projects end. Small, under-resourced, personal projects are not excluded. Discuss and have a plan for this situation. If possible, the records should remain accessible long after work has stopped on the project.


### Stay small, let others create meta-collections

Provide clarity over quantity. Building something small. Even just a few dozen documents focused on a specific topic are valuable in the network. If we’re after a multitude of approaches then there’s value in the tiniest project.


### Strive for universal accessibility, be accessible by default

Provide multiple ways to access the same content. Usability and accessibility must be at the core of an archive. Machine Readability is also there: make your project useful to other projects, devices, search engines, scrapers etc. .

Make the legal accessibility of your project clear: what rights are reserved and how may others use the work? Wide accessibility can support [redundancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation#Replication 'Wikipedia entry for Digital Preservation, section Strategies, Replication') (backup copies).


### Store the original record, present its essense over its resolution.

It’s important to store a copy of the original records as you found them. You don't know what extra interest that master copy may aquire in the future.

Sometimes, presenting this original record may be difficult and even problematic. It’s more important that people can access *something* rather than nothing. If fact many peolpe might need to access a version with a smaller filesize, or just the meta-data. Don't get hung-up on presenting the largest, HD-est version.

### Work together

Invite feedback and new perspectives. It’s the network that enables these projects and makes them valuable by massively increasing how information can be combined. Provide helpful links between projects as much as possible. Share and discussion your methods.


### Be wary of other people’s ideas

Properly documented, your project’s failures may be more valuable to the community than it’s successes. If you think something will further your project’s goals, try it.

As long as it supports your goals, stay independent. If another entity is offering to take over work or contribute to the project, concider whether their priorities are fully compatible with the goals of your project.
