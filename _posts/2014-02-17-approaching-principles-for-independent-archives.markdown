description: "What should an independent archive do? Some starter ideas and an invitation for contributions."
comments: true
---

I'm building an open, independent repository of public interest documents around a specific topic. A place where records of interest can be collected, organised and made accessible. An independent archive.

[Detention Logs](http://detentionlogs.com.au 'Data, documents and investigations that reveal new perspectives on conditions and events inside immigration detention') currently presents [Incident Report data](http://detentionlogs.com.au/data/incidents 'Incident Reports are records of events that occur in immigration detention, recorded by detention centre staff for the Australian Government.'), but we’d like to present more kinds of data and make what's there more accessible.

Below I've collected some [basic principles for an independent archiving project](#principles). These are some of my thoughts on approaching the project and an open invitation for thoughts from others which I'll collect and weave in. The more projects support each other to develop their ideas and practices, the more effective we can all be—

If you've also been thinking about these issues, I'd really encourage you to respond or contribute in some way. Often the smallest, simplest bits are the most useful.

## Why archive?

Recently [I baited](https://twitter.com/equivalentideas/status/431930293625180160 'My original tweet.') some smart people to think about the value in archives [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/431954722581647361 'Jason Scotts apt response'). [Cassie Findlay](https://twitter.com/CassPF 'Cassie Findly on Twitter') came back with this clear response:

Records (the stuff in archives) are evidence. We need evidence to make informed decisions about all kinds of things: personal decisions, political decisions, design decisions, business decisions, policy decisions, etc. . Evidence is crucial to our ideas of legal and social justice and to memory, history, prediction and planning.

An archive is the evidence material *and* the system of its processing, organisation, presentation and access. It's the records and the context around them.

## Collect, Organise, Provide

There are many interesting unreported documents floating around the web: documents that are evidence of government, business and cultural cultural activity. They’ve been ‘officially published’, but barely meet the loosest interpretation of accessibility. An unhelpfully-named, uncategorised file is quietly placed on an obscure or obscuring webpage. No description. Hiding in public.

For example all the [Incident Report data published by Detention Logs](http://detentionlogs.com.au/data/incidents 'Explore Incident Reports, records of events that occur in immigration detention.') had long been available on Immigration Department FOI discloser logs or on googleable web servers. They had gone unreported because it was expensive (time & resources) to understand what they were, process and analyses them. It took us hundreds of hours to get each incident report out of the original pdf.

While there are [Open Government](http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/strategy-and-governance/gov2/declaration-of-open-government.html 'Australian Declaration of Open Government') and [accessibility guidelines](http://webguide.gov.au/accessibility-usability/accessibility/ 'Mandatory Australian Government Accessibility Guidelines'), most of the documents we've collected do not meet them. This is especially true for documents received through the Freedom of Information system.

People in a position of power are [incentivised to be closed](http://equivalentideas.com/journal/tpp-against-a-narrowing-circle/#figure-4 'Quote from Stiglitz, 1999, On Liberty, the Right to Know, and Public Discourse: The Role of Transparency in Public Life') with their information. We need legislation *and* a culture of transparency to make sure people with useful information share it. The act of collecting, categorising, transcoding and republishing evidence to make it more accessible to more people is an important act of accountability journalism. It lowers the cost for others to use and act upon it.

There is also the issue of secret, unofficial, suppressed and censored records: what does the public have a right to know? The question of “what to collect” is obviously crucial, but here I’m just thinking about what to do with records once they are collected.

## Why independent?

Why set up an archive independently? What is the role of projects like [InfoAus](http://infoaus.net/ 'InfoAus is a database journalism project that makes use of open data.'), [OpenAustralia](http://www.openaustralia.org/ 'OpenAustralia aims to make it easy for people to keep tabs on their representatives in Parliament.'), [Homicide Watch](http://homicidewatch.org/ 'Mark every death. Remember every victim. Follow every case.'), [Dronestagram](http://dronestagram.tumblr.com/ 'The drones-eye view.') [Planning Alerts](http://www.planningalerts.org.au/ 'Email alerts of planning applications near you') and [Detention Logs](http://detentionlogs.com.au 'Data, documents and investigations that reveal new perspectives on conditions and events inside immigration detention'). There are big government archives, libraries, journalism institutions, universities and corporations with programs to preserve and provide access to records. Why not leave it to the experts?

As more services become digital, and more people carry devices creating more data with them more of the time, the amount of interesting evidence worth preserving is exploding. The tasks of judging what to keep, what to let go and what should never be collected becomes ever more complex.

The cost of collecting, organising, storing and providing access to this material requires a constant budget, in part because of the unstable nature of digital storage. Funding for the types of institutions that run these projects is not increasing to match this demand.

Already a huge amount of archiving practice has been taken up by corporations like Google, Ansestry and Facebook. We don‘t know the future of these projects, [we just know that a lot of these companies have deleted a huge amount information](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Deathwatch 'Archive Team Death Watch'). There's a strong insurance argument for creating diverse, networked archives.

While there are journalism institutions that publish the primary source material they report on, many don’t. There are certainly legitimate reasons not to publish this material with an article, but you often get the impression that the publisher is in a defensive, competitive head space, not thinking about the longterm value of their work, or the ways in which their audience might want to explore a story. Most institutions deny access by default. Creating open collections of source material is an act of journalism most easily committed by people who don’t live and die by ‘exclusives’.

It's also just not that easy to organise and provide access to source material, even when institutions want to. This stuff is difficult.

There are thousands of years of archiving history, and long established professional communities of archivists, librarians and record keepers. For people working independently, it's important to engage that practice, and draw on its deep knowledge. It's also important to promote the worth of projects on the outside. Many within archivist communities believe their current practices are [buckling under the weight of abundant digital data](http://rkroundtable.org/2013/09/28/reinventing-archival-methods-issues-papers/ 'Reinventing Archival Methods: Issues papers from the Recording Keeping Roundtable'). The unrestrained experiments and improvisations of independent projects can feedback into their toolboxes.

The perspectives of users, archivists, historians, journalists, researchers, designers, engineers, librarians, accountants, administrators, lawyers, teachers, students, artists etc. can be drawn out to answer questions about publishing public records:

* *why* should we collect?
* *what* should we collect?
* *who* should have access, and *why*?
* *What* should they have access to *do* with records?
* *How* can access be provided?

## Small parts loosely joined

At a recent meeting of a few information activist type people, [Joel Pringle](https://twitter.com/pringlejoel 'Joel Pringle on Twitter.') pushed the idea that not every project has to optimise for access by all types of users.

* some projects collect data e.g. [Right To Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/body/dibp 'FOI Requests to the immigration department')
* others organise and present it e.g. [Detention Logs](http://detentionlogs.com.au/data/incidents 'Incident reports collected through FOI, including through the Right To Know system.')
* others engage people in visual stories e.g. [Behind The Wire](http://behindthewire.theglobalmail.org/ 'A graphic portrait of life in detention, using the same data as Detention Logs')

While each of these examples have a clear purpose they also blur across categories. The more projects succeeding and failing with different approaches the better.

Small projects are best positioned to engage focused communities. They should also be open, thoughtfully networked and encourage the potential for widespread access.

Striving for universal accessibility and trying to engage a mass audience are very, very different things. It’s easy for unfunded volunteer projects to stretch themselves too thin. A multitude of networked approaches, overlapping in time and well as topic, will reach the furthest.

## Why Principles?

Principles are a tool that you put your ideas into so that you don’t have to reconsider all the angles from scratch every time you want to make a decision. They say *how* a project will pursue its mission, articulating a shared vision for work.

I'm advocating for lots of small projects with divergent approaches, so why suggested common principles? What I'm really trying to do is get people to share their ideas and experiences in a useful form that can be quickly adapted to other projects. Each projects should have their own distinct principles, and they should be made available on a `/principles` page.

Because principles are modular by nature, you can consider your own project’s position and then drawn on the knowledge of people who’ve been there before. Reuse and plug together a your own personal set of guidelines. [Jeremy Keith’s](http://adactio.com/ 'Jeremy Keith's website) [collection of principles](http://principles.adactio.com 'Design Principles collection') is a great resource.

## How &amp; Why to Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to leave a comment responding to the [principles below](#principles 'Principles for Independent Archives'). You can use the [comment system](#disqus_thread 'Leave a comment'), [email](mailto:luke@equivalentideas.com?subject=RE%20Principles%20for%20Independent%20Archives 'Email Luke Bacon') or [tweet](http://twitter.com/equivalentideas 'Luke Bacon on Twitter') at me, publish a responding blog post, whatever you like. Preferably you should respond somewhere public so everyone can see the discussion. You'll see that I've also made some recommendations for the type of contributions that might be productive.

I've published the principles on [GitHub](https://github.com/equivalentideas/independent-archive-principles/blob/master/independent-archive-principles.md 'Principles for Indpendent Archives on Github') where you can edit and improve them (inspired by [ProPublic's Nerd Guides](https://github.com/propublica/guides 'ProPublica’s News App and Data Style Guides'). I know that not everyone is a GitHub user, [here's quick video on signing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezxRcdJ8glM&list=PLg7s6cbtAD17rhrz2BJWAPJMjR71B3IDx&feature=c4-overview-vl 'How to Create a GitHub Account, A Quick Look') and [a video on why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEN4XNth61o 'Clay Shirky: How the Internet will one day transform government')). Please feel welcome to post changes to the principles in the comments section as well. If there’s ideas in the comments that should be turned into edits on the GitHub repository I can handle that.

Why contribute? There’s a lot of work to do and we need lots of people involved to do it. Most people (like me) don’t have formal training in information management. The more we can share our experiences and knowledge and support the community of people doing this work, the more impact our projects will have. The technological landscape that we’re working in is racing away beneath us—I don't know anyone who feels like they know what’s coming next.

        Belonging to a community means participating, observing, and generally being in attendance (either physically or virtually). But being an advocate requires stepping forward and helping to articulate that community’s needs, or advance their interests, or—when necessary—protect their rights. You need to both amplify and clarify the values of a community, not merely share them.
