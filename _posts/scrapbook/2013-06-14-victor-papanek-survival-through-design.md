Design, if it is to be ecologically responsible and socially responsive, must be revolutionary and radical in the true sense. It must dedicate itself to nature’s principle of least effort, in other words, maximum diversity with minimum inventory (to use Peter Pearce’s good phrase) or doing the most with the least. That means consuming less, using things longer, and being frugal about recycling materials.

The insights, the broad, nonspecialized, interactive overview of a team ... that the designer can bring to the world must now be combined with a sense of social responsibility. In many areas designers must learn how to redesign. In this way we may yet have survival through design.
