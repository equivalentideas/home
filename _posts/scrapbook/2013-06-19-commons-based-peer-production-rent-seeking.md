Despite the positive potential of commons-based peer production, there is cause for concern over its future flourishing. The primary sources of resistance are rent-seeking behavior by incumbent firms of the industrial information economy and well-meaning, but ill-informed policies and judicial decisions. The former stems from the fact that commons-based peer production presents an alternative to, and therefore a form of competition with, the incumbents. The latter arises because policy makers and judges have been habituated by the twentieth-century economics of information production to think that market production, in particular established firms, are critical to growth, innovation and creativity. Relatively few have adjusted to the new economics of networks, and recognized the potential and value of peer production.
