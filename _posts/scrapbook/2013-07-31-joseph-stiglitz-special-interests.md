The second incentive that public officials have for pursuing secrecy is that secrecy provides the opportunity for special interests to have greater sway. In some societies, this takes the naked form of corruption and bribery. But even in societies where this is viewed as unacceptable, politicians need campaign funds to get elected and re-elected. The special interest groups who provide the funds do not do so for the greater public good, but because they believe that by doing so they can influence policy in ways that enhance their profits and profitability. But if these actions in support of special interest groups are subject to public scrutiny, the scope for favoritism is greatly circumscribed. It is in the midnight meetings of the tax committees that the special provisions benefiting one firm or another are introduced. In the words of Justice Brandeis, "sunlight is the most powerful of all disinfectants." Secrecy is the bedrock of this persistent form of corruption, which undermines confidence in democratic governments in so much of the world.
