The press plays an essential role in the battle for openness. But the press, as we have seen, is at the same time a central part of the “conspiracy of secrecy.” The Press must commit itself to working for openness. It is too much to expect them to disclose their secret sources inside the government, or to seek out exclusive sources of information. But there needs to be more reporting on the reporting process itself, exposing the nefarious system, if not the key players.
