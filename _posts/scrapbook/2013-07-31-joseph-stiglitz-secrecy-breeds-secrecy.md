â€“secrecy breeds more of itself. Given that so little information is disclosed, any disclosure of a policy failure is taken as a far more important piece of news. There are thus even greater pressures not to disclose. If more information were disclosed, then the adverse consequences of disclosing a failure would be smaller, and the adverse consequences of not disclosing (of hiding) a failure might be far greater. Given that secrecy is the norm, however, the public does not attach great opprobrium to those who engage in the practice. It is what they have come to expect of public officials, who, after all, they suspect of not really serving in the public interest.
