Openness in process assures the public that the decision does not reflect the exercise of special interests. And a summary of the argument convinces the public that all of the important arguments were considered, all sides were looked at: a judgment was made that the weight of evidence came down in favor of the course of action being undertaken. After all, governments are elected in part to make these difficult judgment calls. What the public wants to know is that there has been real deliberation.
