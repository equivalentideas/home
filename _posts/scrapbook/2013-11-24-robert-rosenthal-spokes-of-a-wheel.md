What I really wanted to do was create a model where you take the core story, the investigation, you think about the spokes of a wheel. Take that story and every spoke of the wheel is a difference platform, so you create a team around the story and push it out on every platform simultaneously.

You have to create an organisation with the internal staff skills and collaboration, working as a unit from the inception till the time you’re gonna publish it across all platforms, and reach the largest audience possible, the way the audience want to receive the story.
