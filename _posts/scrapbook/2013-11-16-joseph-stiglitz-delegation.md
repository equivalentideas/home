To be sure, democratic societies must find and have found ways of engaging expertise in complicated and technical decision-making in a manner that reflects both shared values and expertise. But the decisions cannot reflect just the interests of the industry groups which are likely to have a disproportionate share of expertise and should be forged in ways that leave open both the decisions and the framework within which those decisions should be made to democratic processes. Indeed, to the extent that there has been greater delegation of responsibilities, e.g., to independent agencies, to engage greater expertise and to isolate the decision-making from the vicissitudes of the political process, there appears an even greater need for openness and transparency.
