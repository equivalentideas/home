Secrecy raises the price of informationâ€”in effect, it induces more voters who do not have special interests not to participate actively, leaving the field more to those with special interests. Thus, it is not only that special interests exercise their nefarious activities under the cloak of secrecy, but that the secrecy itself discourages others from providing an effective check on the special interests through informed voting. This highlights the importance of "public information institutions" designed to ferret out information for the benefit of the public: a free and if-need-be adversarial press (as opposed to a captive or lapdog press), the legitimate opposition always playing a probing and possibly devil's advocate role (buttressed by practices like the Opposition's questioning of Government in Parliament), and a myriad of public interest organizations (such as Amnesty International) to blow the whistle on the cloaked activities of the special interest groups.
