In mid-October 2017 some people who gather at Frontyard went on an off-yard  excursion to maintain a Frontyard table at _[VOLUME 2017: Another Art Book Fair](http://vaabf.com/)_ at [Art Space](https://www.artspace.org.au/) in Wolloomooloo, Sydney.

    The second edition of this biennial event features over 70 exhibitors from across Australia and the world, including Amsterdam, Hong Kong, South Korea, France and the United States. Alongside this international line up of publishers, artists, collectives, galleries and distributors is a free program of talks, artist-led workshops, book launches, readings and performances.

The fair was open 3pm-9pm Friday, 11am-6pm Saturday, and 11am-6pm Sunday. The Frontyard table was open and active throughout.

I've made this post to document what we did and some of the decisions we made because we the excursion went quite well and a record of it might be useful in the future.

## Instigating off-yard activity

At the beginning of September 2017, Talia from _VOLUME_ contacted Clare Cooper about Frontyard being involved in the public program for the fair, to run some kind talk, workshop, etc. .

Clare forwarded the email on to the Frontyard janitors (board). Over the next week two janitors sent replies, including this from Benjamin Forster:

In the end no one replied to Talia—there was enthusiasm but no energy to spare—and she emailed to remind us about the invitation, and so it came up at the monthly Frontyard Janitors meeting.

When thinking through how people who meet around Frontyard can be involved in off-yard activities we prioritise activities that will feed energy in rather than require a big expenditure that feeds some external beneficiary. Our tactics include bringing the event to Frontyard, and using the event to focus on something we'd like to do anyway.

One activity that people at Frontyard are trying to build energy for is cataloguing the Frontyard library’s ephemera collection.

The Frontyard library was our Australia Council for the Arts research library, until they decommissioned it in 2014. It's now installed at Frontyard and is accessible once again as a non-lending library that anyone can visit. Most of it is catalogued and available to browse, but there are still about 900 'ephemera' works to be added.

The janitors came up with the idea of taking these boxes and the existing task of cataloguing them to the book fair, so that through our involvement we could produce something of benefit to the people who meet at Frontyard and to welcome new people to join us in the activity of building a shared public resource.

I emailed Talia back with our idea. Though it wasn't what she had originally proposed, she supported us by making space for a Frontyard table at _VOLUME_.

A few days after the janitors meeting, Pip, Ben, Sally, and I had a practice day to kick-off our cataloguing. We created a Google Form for entering the information we needed about the form:

* the title;
* the number of the box it came out of;
* the URL for the work on the Australian National Library’s Trove database (we can use this link to later pull all kinds of useful information), alternatively if it's not in their collection: the author, publisher, year published, and language; and,
* a photo of the cover of the work.

I've found Google Forms to be really helpful it experimenting with data entry forms. The responses go to a spreadsheet you can work with, and you can also access a data feed of the entries via a public URL, if you open up the share settings.

Someone, Sophea or Sally, came up with the idea of taking cuttings from the Frontyard garden to make tea with—to recreate the Frontyard experience for people at the fair.

## The Frontyard table

<figure id="figure-5" class="graphic-figure central-figure"><img alt="Photo of the table" /></figure>

Frontyard’s table was first within the entrance to the eastern room at Art Space (left inside the main entrance).

It was a rectangular trestle table. The short-ends faced west towards the entrance and east towards the eastern edge of Art Space. The eastern edge sat flat against a concrete, structural column.

On the western end of Frontyard’s table (closest to the entrance) were a couple of piles of items from the uncatalogued ephemera collection of the Frontyard Library.

From the centre of the table to the eastern edge sat:

* a box (a solid, wood table draw) with a paper note labelling the contents "done";
* a notebook, an [iPad mini](), and box of marker pens tucked behind the box;
* a bowl of [sage]() and [thyme]() from the Frontyard garden and [mint]() and [fennel]() frons from the [107 Projects garden]();
* coffee cups from the Frontyard kitchen on a tea towel;
* a red, metal teapot from the Frontyard kitchen; and,
* a television monitor, lent against the concrete column, showing images of the most recent catalogued books taken by the cataloguers (images were loaded into a web page using [a script hosted on GitHub]()).

All these elements sat on top of butchers paper, and a white table cloth covered the table.

Along the south western edge of the table "" was written on the butches paper.
An arrow pointed from here to the "" with the URL for the online cataloguing form. An arrow pointed from this instruction to the wooden box, indicating to put the catalogued items in the box. These were the basic cataloguing instructions.

Under the table (from west to east) sat:

* two cardboard boxes of uncatalogued ephemera from the Frontyard library;
* a black plastic storage box with people’s bags, spare pens, tape for labeling everything, and other stuff;
* a large, clear plastic storage box of catalogued items;
* a power board, powering a [laptop]() (Friday-Saturday afternoon) then a [Mac Mini]() (Saturday afternoon-Sunday) which were connected to the display monitor.

## Cataloguing at the book fair

A small group of people were cataloguing the ephemera collection of Frontyard’s Library at the table. The size of the group ranged between 1 and 5 people in size throughout the event. Over the three days—in-between conversations, strolls through the fair, and reading—they catalogued XXXX items.

The cataloguers would pick up an item from the western side of the table, and enter information about it into an online form a http://goo.gl.drZn35 .

Here's the form..

The cataloguers used their own phones, or the iPad at the table, to open the form in a web browser and enter the details about their item.

There was an issue with the uploading stage of the Google Form regularly crashing the browser of the device the cataloguer was using. This was very frustrating as the cover photo capturing was at the end of the form and it would cause the person to loose their work for this item. They discussed that their might be a need to try a system that was less memory intensive on the devices in the future. As the form was quite short, this frustration wasn't a blocker to people continuing to catalogue items.

As they catalogued they also welcomed passers by to join and had sometimes long conversations about the collection and it's life at Frontyard.

They noted down some of what happened in the notebook:

Benjamin made a book of 100 cover photos taken in the cataloguing process as part of the VOLUME Book machinasdfasf.

## What's next

I really enjoyed the excursion. It was nice to spend an intense weekend with the people who meet around Frontyard and people presenting at and attending the book fair. Highlights were the stalls from the Asia Photobook Archive, Onamatapee, Gem stones, and Frontyard friend Nicky Minus.

There's still XXXXX items to catalogue.

Our idea is that once the catalogue is complete, we'll have the information we need to organise it and design some system through which it can be accessible reliably.

That goal is one motivator, but it's a way off. I think we need to do something with the growing catalogue to make it useful to people and to incentivise the ongoing cataloguing. Maybe we should have a Frontyard residency to experiment and create something?

As we organise this and create ways to present and access the collection, we need to think why the collection languished at the Australia Council. How can we avoid that happening again? How can we [avoid re-creating the power structures](http://www.mikejonesonline.com/contextjunky/2017/09/27/metadata-and-power-toward-relational-agency-in-archival-description/) that prevent people from living freely, critically, and creatively? I think input from people who’ve been part of the [Decolonising Solidarity]() reading group at Frontyard could provide useful input to this project.

I think one reason Frontyard exists is to try and reduce the pressure on people that prevents them from living creatively. Can the library address this pressure and increase people's freedom to live and think critically?
