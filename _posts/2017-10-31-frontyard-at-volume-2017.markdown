## what was the event?

In mid-October 2017 some people who gather at Frontyard went on an off-yard  excursion to maintain a Frontyard table at _[VOLUME 2017 | Another Art Book Fair](http://vaabf.com/)_ at [Art Space](https://www.artspace.org.au/) in Wolloomooloo, Sydney.

The fair was open 3pm-9pm Friday, 11am-6pm Saturday, and 11am-6pm Sunday. The Frontyard table was open and active throughout.

This post documents the off-yard excursion.

## We were asked to be there?

Talia from Volume contacted Clare Cooper about Frontyard being involved in the public program for the fair, to run some kind talk/workshop etc. .

When organisations contact Frontyard about being involved in their events, the Frontyard janitors...

## What were the elements of our setup?

Frontyard’s table was first within the entrance to the eastern room at Art Space (left inside the main entrance).

It was a rectangular tressle-table. The short-ends faced west towards the entrance and east towards the eastern edge of Art Space. The eastern edge sat flat against a concrete, structural column.

On the western end of Frontyard’s table (closest to the entrance) were a couple of piles of items from the uncatalogued ephemera collection of the Frontyard Library.

From the centre of the table to the eastern edge sat:

* a box (a solid, wood table draw) with a paper note labelling the contents "done";
* a notebook, an [iPad mini](), and box of marker pens tucked behind the box;
* a bowl of [sage]() and [thyme]() from the Frontyard garden and [mint]() and [fennel]() frons from the [107 Projects garden]();
* coffee cups from the Frontyard kitchen on a tea towel;
* a red, metal teapot from the Frontyard kitchen; and,
* a television monitor, lent against the concrete column, showing images of the most recent catalogued books taken by the cataloguers (images were loaded into a web page using [a script hosted on GitHub]()).

All these elements sat on top of butchers paper, and a white table cloth covered the table.

Along the south western edge of the table "" was written on the butches paper.
An arrow pointed from here to the "" with the URL for the online cataloguing form. An arrow pointed from this instruction to the wooden box, indicating to put the catalogued items in the box. These were the basic cataloguing instructions.

Under the table (from west to east) sat:

* two cardboard boxes of uncatalogued ephemera from the Frontyard library;
* a black plastic storage box with people’s bags, spare pens, tape for labeling everything, and other stuff;
* a large, clear plastic storage box of catalogued items;
* a power board, powering a [laptop]() (Friday-Saturday afternoon) then a [Mac Mini]() (Saturday afternoon-Sunday) which were connected to the display monitor.

## What did we do?

A small group of people were cataloguing the ephemera collection of Frontyard’s Library at the table. The size of the group ranged between 1 and 5 people in size throughout the event.

Frontyard Library is our decommissioned Australia Council for the Arts Library.

The ephemera collection includes ...

The cataloguers would pick up an item from the western side of the table, and enter some information about it into an online form a http://goo.gl.drZn35 .

Here's the form..

The cataloguers used their own phones, or the iPad at the table, to open the form in a web browser and enter the details about their item.

There was an issue with the uploading stage of the Google Form regularly crashing the browser of the device the cataloguer was using. This was very frustrating as the cover photo capturing was at the end of the form and it would cause the person to loose their work for this item. They discussed that their might be a need to try a system that was less memory intensive on the devices in the future. As the form was quite short, this frustration wasn't a blocker to people continuing to catalogue items.

Discussions with people.

## What does it say in the notebook?

## What did we achieve?

## What's next

Document this.

Do something to make the catalogue useful.

Catalogue more.

In providing some way for people to access the items in the collection, how can we [avoid re-creating the power structures](Mike Jones post) that prevent people from living freely, critically, and creatively?

I think input from people who’ve been part of the [Decolonising Solidarity](http://www.mikejonesonline.com/contextjunky/2017/09/27/metadata-and-power-toward-relational-agency-in-archival-description/) reading group at Frontyard could be very useful in exploring that question.
