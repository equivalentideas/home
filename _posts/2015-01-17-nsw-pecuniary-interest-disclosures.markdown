If any of the entries are wrong [let me know](/contact) and I'll see what I can do.

This wouldn't have been possible without the work of [Henare Degan](https://twitter.com/henaredegan), [Jamie Pillora](https://github.com/jpillora) and everyone who came to the [#nswvotes meetup this week](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/219652731/) and made it such a fun night.

## Process

1. Download the [Register of Disclosures by Members of the Legislative Assembly as at 30 June 2014 (Volumes One and Two)](http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/la/latabdoc.nsf/062281a7012b5820ca257020000a3058/d8ec3278d94e2783ca257d71001a8111?OpenDocument), [via a NSW Legislative Assembly Tabled Paper Search](http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/la/latabdoc.nsf/TabledDocumentsAll?SearchView&query=([REPORTTITLE]=(register*+of*+disclosures*))&searchorder=4). It's in two separate, massive PDF documents. Sadly these are scans of the forms submitted by MPs. Some have been filled digitally and some have been hand written. Believe it or not, but even in 2014 it looks like at least one of the documents was filled out using a typewriter.
2. Separate the individual forms out of the PDF into individual forms. For [Volume One](http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/la/latabdoc.nsf/062281a7012b5820ca257020000a3058/d8ec3278d94e2783ca257d71001a8111/$FILE/Volume%201%20-%20Ordinary%20Returns%20-%20October%202014.pdf) I had the out put from [Jaimie’s script](https://github.com/jpillora/disclosure-parser), which was a folder containing a image for each page, for each individual form. I used an Automator Workflow to sew the individual images back into PDFs with a page for each sheet. Unfortunately I had to target each folder, one-by-one (if anyone works out how to do a [loop like this](https://discussions.apple.com/message/21053313#24471966) successfully please let me know). For [Volume Two](http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/la/latabdoc.nsf/062281a7012b5820ca257020000a3058/d8ec3278d94e2783ca257d71001a8111/$FILE/Volume%202%20-%20Ordinary%20Returns%20-%20October%202014.pdf) I manually pulled apart the individual forms from the big PDF [using Preview](http://www.howtogeek.com/201519/use-your-mac%E2%80%99s-preview-app-to-merge-split-mark-up-and-sign-pdfs/).
3. Rename each PDF with the name of the MP it belongs to. I named them using the [names on NSW Parliament’s website](http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/V3ListCurrentLAMembers). These are the commonly used versions of there names, rather than what they entered on their form. For example Giovanni (John) Domenic Barilaro has the file name 'Barilaro_John.pdf'. I went last name first for the file names to sort them alphabetically by last name, as is common.

Maybe someone can run through this process for the 2012-2013 register.
