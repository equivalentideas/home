Last month I went to my [local council meeting](http://waverley.infocouncil.biz/Open/2016/02/CM_20160216_MIN_366.PDF "Waverley Council Meeting Minutes, 16 February 2016").
It was the first meeting I'd been to since moving to Bondi three years ago,
and the second local council meeting I've ever been to.

Recently I've been working to make it easier for people
to learn about and contribute to local planning decisions through [PlanningAlerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au).
I’ve been speaking with local councillors from around NSW to find out
how they think people can impact local planning decisions more effectively.
So far they've all said that people should go to their local meetings.
I wanted to see why.

I'm really glad I went along.
It seems that important decisions are made in local council
meetings–but there are also heaps of problems with them.

My representatives were debating how involved local people should be in
guiding a $40 million redevelopment of
the area’s best known and much loved public facility, [the Bondi Pavilion]().

The key issues were the amount of time locals should have to make submissions
and what project information they should have access to.
There were about 15 people watching the meeting.
It seemed to me they were all strongly for extending the submission time
and wanted more information about the project.
I had no idea about the plan before last night.

I'm not familiar with them,
but I thought Councillors [John Wakefield](http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/council/councillors/bondi_ward#john )
and [Dominic (Darugland Boondi Boondi) Wy Kanak](http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/council/councillors/bondi_ward#dominic)
did a good job standing up for greater public involvement in the redevelopment.
I was pretty shocked by the conservative majority of councillors
who made snide remarks and spoke against
what seemed like reasonable public participation.

Local council meetings in Australia have a reputation
for being ineffective and boring.
This reputation is totally off the mark in my area.
They debated important issues and proposals
that will impact this area and it's people.
There were some things however
that made it hard to understand what was going on.

## Problems

When I first arrived there was a lot of confusion and bickering
about what the proper meeting procedure was.
This was boring and frustrating.
Councillors were talking over each other,
brandishing the meeting rules document in hand.
One kept interrupting the others
only to then realise they were misreading the rules.
These interruptions made the actual debate harder to follow
for both the audience and councillors.
The procedure is meant to help meetings run well,
but it seemed more like a prop for political theatre last night.

There was constant miscommunication
about what was being said throughout the meeting.
It seemed to me that there were a few causes for this:

  * The councillors spoke in the language of stuffy government procedure
    rather than just saying what they meant.
    This made it hard for everyone, even the other councillors,
    to nail down the precise point at hand.
  * [Mayor Sally Betts]() who was running the meeting
    kept leaning over to talk to council staff while people were speaking.
    This meant that they had to constantly
    reconfirm the questions and motions being raised.
    People around me in the audience kept
    shaking their heads–“they’re not even bloody listening”.
  * The room had really bad acoustics that muffled what was said.
    This problem was made worse by councillors having cross conversations
    while motions were being put forward.
    The councillors also sat facing away from the public audience,
    projecting their voices away from them.

## Accessibility and participation

There were a problems with transparency and accountability as well.

Even in the room it was difficult to tell
how councillors were voting on motions.

This is the key job we elect these people to do,
yet most votes are held ‘on the voices’. This means that the ...

This is a major problem of accountability for elected representatives
at every level of government in Australia.
Micaela .. recently wrote a [great post about it in Federal Parliament]().

You might think that the people attending the meeting would
be able to tell how individual councillors voted, but this wasn't really clear.
The councillors sit facing away from the audience,
so when they call out their vote you can't always distinguish their position.

On the issue of the Bondi Pavillion redevelopment,
Councillor Dominic Wy Kanak moved that a detailed breakdown of the costing
and a feasibility study of the project be released.
In a major redevelopment of one of the area’s most significant built assets,
wouldn't you expect that this kind of detail of the plan
would be available already?

One of the council staff stood to explain that this wouldn't be possible.
Releasing such detail might result in the council
getting a worse deal on the project.
The explanation of why this would happen wasn't clear to me—but
I think it's beside the point.

A public institution like a local council isn't like a normal business.
It works on behalf of the public and has a bunch of special processes
to ensure it acts in the public interest.
These include having an elected council and holding open public meetings.
These measure aren't cheap to run,
but are seen as a core cost of council business.

Transparency in democratic institutions isn't a “nice to have”.
If it costs more for the public to get reasonable detail
of the plan they need to judge,
then surely those are basic, core costs of business.
They might actually find that transparency enables locals to
better direct resources, saving resources and increasing effectiveness.

From just this meeting I observed these barriers
people understanding what their local public institutions are planning and doing;
barriers to acting in their local democracy.
I was impressed by a few councillors who spoke for
the public’s right to know and direct their council.
I think I'll head back this month and see what else I can learn.
