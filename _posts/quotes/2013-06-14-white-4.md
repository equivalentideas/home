The power of transformation is not something new; nature transforms itself continuously. It requires much energy and consistency to preserve beautiful things, so we must observe transforming nature closely, capturing its stillness while advocating its immutable and universal features. In this sense, Zen temples are instructive, for they embody the commitment that is needed to preserve beauty through daily effort. Their pebbled white gardens can be taken as symbols of this principle of preservation.
