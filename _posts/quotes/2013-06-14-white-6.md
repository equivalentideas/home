Things like the rich golden yellow of the yoke from a broken egg, or the color of tea brimming in a teacup, are not merely colors; rather they are perceived at a deeper level through their texture and their taste, attributes inherent in their material nature. People perceive color through the combination of such elements. In this regard, color is not understood through our visual senses alone, but through all our senses. Insofar as color systems are based solely on the physical, visual nature of objects, they cannot convey our total response.
